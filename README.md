This paper presents an empirical analysis of parallel computing paradigms for CPU-bound batch image processing workloads. As modern applications demand high-throughput analysis of large image datasets, traditional sequential processing quickly becomes a critical bottleneck. We systematically measure the performance of various parallel pipelines—sequential, threaded (using ThreadPoolExecutor), and process-based (using ProcessPoolExecutor)—on a fixed, CPU-intensive image processing task (combining grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and edge detection). Experiments are conducted across varied parameters, including the number of worker processes/threads, total image count (N), and image resolution. By quantifying the wall-clock runtime, speedup, and throughput (images/sec), this study identifies the most effective parallel strategy for this class of workload. Results demonstrate that utilizing true multiprocessing via ProcessPoolExecutor provides the superior scalability and performance for CPU-bound image filtering tasks by effectively leveraging multiple CPU cores, confirming the necessity of High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques over naive threading in CPU-limited environments.
